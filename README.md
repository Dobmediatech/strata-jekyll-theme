To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

This theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test this theme, run
`bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.
This starts a Jekyll server using this theme and contents. As you make
modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the
browser after a refresh.

## Credits

This Jekyll theme is taken from [Strata by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).
Additionally, a lot inspiration was taken from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

A simple, minimalist template that actually began life as an unused redesign of my
personal site. Includes a (configurable) parallax background effect, Poptrox-powered
lightbox gallery, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and Sass sources for the Sass-inclined.
